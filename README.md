# Mini Projects 

This repo is set up to document some of the smaller projects I have worked on for school or uni. These projects are small and were relatively quick to build but demonstrate my long term interest in programming and highlight many of my skills. 

In particular:

- Creativity
- Ability and willingness to learn new skills and push myself past an imidiate scope
- Ability to replicate techniques given limitations like programming language
